      <p id="tribute-info">Credo Mutwa was fortunate enough to find a strong and godly woman who loved him, a woman that become his wife and the mother
        of his seven children. He was a sculptor, who has created large sculptures in various parts of South Africa. A painter who has
        painted pictures that were afterwards stolen from him, by exploiters. He was a writer of books, whose books fill the pockets of
        others with money, and not his own. That is Credo Mutwa. He has used the knowledge he acquired over many years of investigation
        and travel to create job opportunities for his starving people. The villages that he built in Soweto, and which were destroyed
        by misguided youths. The villages that he built in Mafekeng, and the village and the statues that he built in the Eastern Cape,
        placed bread in the hands of his starving fellow South Africans. He created jobs where there were none. He believed that a truly
        democratic country, is a country that uses the spiritual talents and the heritage of its people to feed the hungry and clothe
        the naked.</p>

      <p>While growing up that it was discovered that he was something of a visionary and a prophet. A talent, which together with
        an artistic inclination, to draw and to sculpt, he did not attend school until he was well within his 14th year of life, because
        his family kept on travelling as a result of his fathers building profession. Taking him from town to town, they became a family
        of travellers, who never stayed long in one place</p>

      <p>In <year>1937</year> he went through great shock and trauma, when he was seized and sodomized by a gang of mineworkers outside a
        mine compound which caused him to be ill for a long time. He then began to question many things he didn't before <q>Where our
          ancestors really the savages that quiet missionaries would have us believe they were? Were we Africans really a race of primitives
          who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?</q>. These and many more questions began to haunt his mind,
        the day he was certain was the day he returned fully to his health. His grandfather told him that the illness that had been
        troubling him for so long, had actually been a sacred illness which required him to become a shaman, a healer. After hearing all
        this, he readily agreed to undergo initiation at the hands of one of his grandfather's daughters, a young sangoma named Myrna.</p>

      <p>Upon hearing this news, his father and stepmother told his maternal uncle that he was never to set foot in their home again. He
        was on his own, a youth without a home, without family and so he began his travelling. He first went to Swaziland and then the land
        of the Basotho, he developed a wanderlust that was to be with him until his last day. The travelling was not for enjoyment however
        it was for knowledge, in search of clarity of mind and the truth about his people. He met all different people through his travels
        missionaries, miners and came into contact with men and women of countries that I had not known about before. He experienced things,
        which only those who walk the path of the healer in Africa experience.</p>

      <p>As the years past, he became filled with a fanatical obsession. He realized how rapidly Africa was changing, to his shock and
        sorrow that the culture of his people, a culture that he had thought immortal, was actually dying. Very, very soon the Africa that
        he knew would become a forgotten thing. A thing of the past and he decided to try and preserve somehow, what he could of his people's
        culture. <q>How was I to do that?</q> he asked, friends advised him to write books. One friend advised him to build living museums
        in which he would preserve the dying culture of his people, and he struggled very hard to bring these things about. He wrote books,
        and tried to borrow money from banks and organizations supposedly established to help black people who wanted to establish businesses.</p>

      <p>Again and again, he was disappointed until, after long years of struggle. Year <year>1975</year> he succeeded in obtaining permission
        and funds to build the first living museum, for the preservation of his people's knowledge, religion and culture, in the centre of Soweto.
        Many black people misunderstood the purpose of having built this living museum, they falsely accused him of cooperating with the apartheid
        regime and of quote<q>glamorising the Soweto ghetto</q>.</p>

      <p>He did not see himself as a politician, he saw himself as a healer, whose duty was to preserve the greatness of his people, regardless
        of which government happened to be in power in South Africa. He saw himself as a healer whose purpose was to create job opportunities
        for his starving people in Soweto, regardless of whether they were ruled by the apartheid regime or the A.N.C government. He believed
        firmly that knowledge was about politics and that a race that did not know its true greatness, will never obtain full freedom. He was
        saddened by the fact that our people were making huge sacrifices, fighting for freedom when they did not know their full greatness. He
        said to himself and his late wife, Cecilia that if our people gain freedom under these circumstances, that freedom would be an illusion
        and a fraud.</p>
